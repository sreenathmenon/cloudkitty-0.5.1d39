        Goal
        ----
        
        CloudKitty aims at filling the gap between metrics collection systems like
        ceilometer and a billing system.
        
        Every metrics are collected, aggregated and processed through different rating
        modules. You can then query CloudKitty's storage to retrieve processed data and
        easily generate reports.
        
        Most parts of CloudKitty are modular so you can easily extend the base code to
        address your particular use case.
        
        You can find more information on its architecture in the documentation,
        `architecture section`_.
        
        
        Status
        ------
        
        CloudKitty has been successfully deployed in production on different OpenStack
        systems.
        
        You can find the latest documentation on readthedocs_.
